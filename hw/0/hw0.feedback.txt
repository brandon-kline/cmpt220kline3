Brandon,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)

- Excellent!

However,

- A little header or cover page with your name, class, assignment, date, etc.
  is always good to have in any assignment of this type. Handwriting is not
  formal and seems improvised.



Peace,
