Brandon,

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that there are incorrect statements.  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- You used tabs, which is forbidden. -1pt

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.


About your essay:

- Good writing and analysis.



Peace,
