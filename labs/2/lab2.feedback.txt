Brandon, 

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled.  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- I can't believe my eyes! What is that code? Horrible style!

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

- Most class names do not start with capital letter. They must.

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.



Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
